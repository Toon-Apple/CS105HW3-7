You may ask
Why must you bask
In Nakai's glory
I just want to tell his Story
It is deep dark and Beautiful, Like a quarry
Now you, Why must you bring this upon me, the reader
THe answer is my passion is larger than a cedar
Now you must be wishing that this will end
and that is that is the truth, with a little bend
for the poem may be soon done
but worry not for my ability to make poems is like the sun
It is bright, vibrant, and endless enough to stun
you thought I was done?
well I am
